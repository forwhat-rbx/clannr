## Note on Discord API

Bots must follow Discord’s developer terms. Review them here before deploying Clannr:

You’re responsible for creating a privacy policy—this can be a simple document stating “We don’t collect personal data” with a contact link for questions. If anything’s unclear, the [Discord Developers server](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) is a good place to ask.
